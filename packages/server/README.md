# @sub37/server

This is the core package, where magic happens.

It is a client side library with the role of making common interfaces for adapters and renderers available and keeping the tracks for cues distribution session (when a content starts).

## What you need to know

Before start using `sub37`, you need to know the following aspects:

1. Which formats of subtitles are you going to support
2. Where to get and how to get the tracks you want to show
3. Need to know if your raw tracks need some kind of conversion
4. Need to know how to connect it with the player states

`sub37` doesn't perform any kind of conversion of your tracks before sending them to the adapters. It is suggested to ensure yourself that tracks are, if a text, in UTF-8.

## Importing

`server`Â exposes a class that will let you associate the renderers you might want to use.

```typescript
import { Server, Events, Errors } from "@sub37/server";

const server = new Server(...adapters);
```

Provided adapters will be available as long as a Server instance is available.

## Starting a new session

Server works with sessions. Once the instance is created, it will be possible to create and start a distribution session.

A session is described by the tracks that get specified. User will have to specify them with the following properties:

```typescript
interface TrackRecord {
	lang: string /** arbitrary language id */;
	content: unknown;
	mimeType: `${string}/${string}`;
	active?: boolean;
}

server.createSession([
	{
		lang: "ita",
		content: "WEBVTT ...",
		mimeType: `text/vtt`,
		active: true;
	},
	...
]);
```

By default **no track is considered active** if not determined with the `active` parameter. Not specifying an active track and starting the server, might cause an `ActiveTrackMissingError` when attempting to start the server.

Once created the session, you can `start` it. In order to be synchronized with your video element, when starting the session, `server` requires you to specify a callback that will get invoked at every check (a "tick"; every tick happens once an amount of time - specified by the second parameter - passes). That callback is expected to return the current position.

Tick's default time is `250ms`.

```typescript
server.start(() => {
	return myVideoElement.currentTime;
}, 300);
```

Attempting to start a server before creating a `session`, will cause a `SessionNotInitializedError` to be fired.

## Changing server states

Server can be paused by using the `.suspend()` method and resumed by using the `.resume()` method.

When server is suspended, the callback passed to `start` will stop being invoked. Therefore, if a seek happens, subtitles won't be updated.

To prevent this issue, there's a method that can be called only when the server is suspended: `.updateTime()`. It accepts an amount of time in milliseconds as a parameter.

Using it, the server will perform an update of cues and send them to the renderer.

```typescript
videoElement.addEventListener("pause", () => {
	if (server.isRunning) {
		server.suspend();
	}
});

videoElement.addEventListener("playing", () => {
	if (!server.isRunning) {
		server.resume();
	}
});

videoElement.addEventListener("seeking", () => {
	server.updateTime(videoElement.currentTime * 1000);
});

videoElement.pause();
videoElement.currentTime = 12; /** seconds **/
```

## Attaching a renderer

In order to distribute the subtitles, the server must be attached to the `captions-renderer`.

This can be done through `.addEventListener`. A listener can be removed through `.removeEventListener`. These two methods accept the event name and the callback to be invoked, just like an [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget).

The events available are exposed from the package. Two events are required to be listened to so that everything works fine: `Events.CUE_START` and `Events.CUE_STOP`.

- When `CUE_START` is fired, a new set of cues to be shown will be sent to the renderer.
- When `CUE_STOP` is fired, no cues will be shown and the renderer will remove them all.

A third optional event can be listened to: `CUE_ERROR`. This is an event that gets fired when some non-critical errors get fired, like a malformed cue. You can do whatever you want to do with it. The callback will contain the error.

```typescript
import { Events } from "@sub37/server";

const renderer = document.getElementsByTagName("captions-renderer")[0];

server.addEventListener(Events.CUE_START, renderer.setCue);
server.addEventListener(Events.CUE_STOP, renderer.setCue);
server.addEventListener(Events.CUE_ERROR, (/** @type {Error} */ error) => {
	console.log(error);
});
```

## Tracks Management

When a session gets created and raw tracks get provided, they get converted into `Tracks`.
A Track has the following attributes:

- Can be active or inactive;
- Knows which is adapter has been used;
- Can be augmented with more content;

When a track is active, its cues will be actively served.

It might be in your interest to always have an active track to show subtitles instead of captions.

> ### Captions vs Subtitles
>
> Althought captions and subtitles might feel to be the same concept, the edge is really thin:
>
> - "subtitles" are for people that can hear but cannot understand a language. It is common for films to have a single active track dedicated to translations.
>
> - "captions" are for people that cannot hear audio and hence require the written words.
>
> Translation tracks are usually included inside caption tracks, but you can also have two or more different tracks to toggle.

### Toggling a track

To activate a track, you can retrieve it and activate it with its _getter_ as follows:

```typescript
const tracks = server.tracks;
/** Language is specified inside the raw track */
const italianTrack = tracks.find((track) => track.lang === "ita");
italianTrack.active = true;
```

`@sub37/server` also owns a _getter_ as a shortcut just to retrieve all the tracks languages loaded:

```typescript
const langs = server.availableLanguages; // e.g. ["ita", "eng", "de"]
```

### Adding content to a track

Raw content can be added to tracks whenever needed, to achieve a live-captioning effect.

Please note that, as per v1.0.0, the only requirement is that each new raw chunk that you might want to add, should be available to be used as a standalone track.

For example, for WebVTT tracks, the sheet is required to start with the uppercase characters sequence "WEBVTT". So, new chunks will require it too.

```typescript
const italianTrack = server.tracks.find((track) => track.lang === "ita");
italianTrack.addChunk(`
WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey mom, look at me, I'm having fun!
`);
```

## Error handling

All `sub37` functions are as safe as possible and, when things go wrong, throw explicative errors so that issues can be diagnosed easily. All the exposed errors can be used importing the `Errors` namespace as shown below.

```typescript
try {
	...
} catch (err) {
	if (err instance of Errors.ParsingError) {
		/** do something */
	}
}
```

These are the errors that might get fired. Some might just get logged in console. Others might get fired when attempting to use methods.
